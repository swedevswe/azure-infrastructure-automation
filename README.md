Project: Azure Infrastructure Automation with ARM Templates
Tools & Technologies: Azure CLI, Visual Studio Code, Windows 11, ARM Templates, Azure VMs, Azure Networking, Azure Storage

Description:

    Designed and implemented a secure and scalable Azure infrastructure.
    Automated provisioning and management using ARM templates.
    Deployed virtual networks, subnets, virtual machines, and storage accounts.
    Configured network security groups and route tables for enhanced security and traffic management.
    Enforced organizational standards with Azure Resource Manager policies.
    Demonstrated expertise in infrastructure as code (IaC).
    
Steps Involved:

    Creation of ARM Templates:
        Developed ARM templates to deploy virtual networks, subnets, virtual machines, and storage accounts.
        Ensured the templates were modular and reusable for different environments.

    Network and Security Configuration:
        Configured Network Security Groups (NSGs) and route tables.
        Managed security and traffic within the Azure environment effectively.

    Infrastructure Deployment:
        Used Azure CLI to deploy the infrastructure defined in the ARM templates.
        Validated the deployment to ensure all resources were provisioned correctly.

    Policy Enforcement:
        Implemented Azure Resource Manager policies.
        Enforced organizational standards and compliance requirements.
        
Key Achievements:

    Automation: Successfully automated the deployment process, reducing manual intervention and the potential for errors.
    Scalability: Ensured the infrastructure could scale easily based on demand.
    Security: Implemented robust security measures through NSGs and route tables.
    Compliance: Enforced compliance with organizational policies using Azure Resource Manager.
    
Outcome: Achieved a fully automated, secure, and scalable Azure infrastructure deployment.
